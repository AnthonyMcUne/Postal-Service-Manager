#HI! This is my Postal Service Manager Application! 
#This only has a simple GUI that will appear in the terminal once the main.py is run. 
#To install and run the application, make sure that Python is up-to-date on your computer and download the application, opening it in your preferred IDE. (Visual Studio Code is free and available on the Microsoft Store!)
#After downloading all the necessary files, simply run main.py.
